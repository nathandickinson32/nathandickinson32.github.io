          Dungeon Adventure is an immersive text-based adventure game that challenges players with a 
          series of strategic choices. Set in a richly detailed world, players must navigate 
          through encounters where they decide to fight random enemies, run, or heal themselves. 
          The game offers a variety of weaponry and armor, allowing players to craft their own 
          unique approach to combat.

          A distinctive feature of Dungeon Adventure is the emphasis on decision 
          permanenceâ€”players must live with the choices they make, which influence the game's 
          outcome. The journey includes solving a challenging riddle, leading up to a
           climactic boss battle that tests the skills and decisions of the player. 
           Developed during the early weeks of programming, TextQuest is a testament to the 
           capabilities of Java, showcasing fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.
            The game combines classic elements of interactive storytelling with strategic 
            gameplay, offering a compelling experience that emphasizes the weight of choice 
            and consequence.
