      The Second Nature app is designed to streamline communication and enhance
      productivity within a landscaping team. Built using Java Object-Oriented
      Programming and Vue.js, the app features tools like the Kudos Board for
      employee recognition, equipment management for tracking resources, a
      robust maintenance ticketing system, and an easy-to-use time-off request
      process. Our team has been collaborating closely with the product owner to
      ensure the app meets the needs of the workforce. These features work
      together to improve daily operations, foster a collaborative work
      environment, and keep the team connected and efficient.

    The Time Off feature simplifies leave requests by letting employees submit,
    track, and manage their time off. This ensures easy approval processes and
    clear visibility for both employees and managers.

    The Kudos Board lets employees easily recognize and celebrate each otherâ€™s
    achievements. This feature fosters a positive work environment by allowing
    real-time shoutouts and appreciation posts.
